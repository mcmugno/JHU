<!--
	a. Create a snippet placeholder for about.html. Change the link to the ‘About’ page such that the contents of the about.html snippet are loaded within the same index.html page, replacing the ‘home’ view content. In this page, you will implement and show a simple 5-star based rating of the restaurant. (The only thing is that it will be a random rating.) 
-->

<!--
	c. In the about.html snippet (or partial as it’s sometimes called), create 5 span tags with empty content. How you choose to position them in the page is up to you. They just have to be all in a row (not stacking). Each span will have a class attribute with a property we’ll substitute later using our insertProperty function. So, the first one should be <span class=""></span>, the second one should be <span class=""></span>, and so on until the last, 5th one. 
-->

	<span class="{{starProp1}}"></span>
	<span class="{{starProp2}}"></span>
	<span class="{{starProp3}}"></span>
	<span class="{{starProp4}}"></span>
	<span class="{{starProp5}}"></span>


<!--
	(Bonus/Optional) A really easy one. Display the numeric/textual number of stars right next to the star icons. For example, after the 4 filled in stars and one empty star, it should say the words “4-star rating”.
